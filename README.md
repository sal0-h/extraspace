Extraspace makes your Android tablet appear in **Settings → Displays** as a genuine
monitor. Not a screen-share window, not a VNC session — a real output you can drag
windows onto, arrange, and give its own workspaces. Touch the tablet and it drives
the cursor there.

It also sends the tablet's camera back the other way, exposing it to Linux as an
ordinary webcam that Firefox, Zoom, OBS and Cheese pick up automatically.

Everything runs over the **USB cable**. No network, no cloud, no account.

## Why this exists

Most "tablet as second screen" tools on Linux mirror an existing display, or need
X11, or route video over Wi-Fi with the latency that implies. On GNOME Wayland
specifically, creating a *new* output has historically meant DisplayLink drivers
or the EVDI kernel module.

It turns out mutter can already do it. `org.gnome.Mutter.ScreenCast` has a
`RecordVirtual` method that creates a monitor with no backing hardware, and
`org.gnome.Mutter.RemoteDesktop` can inject touch events whose coordinates are
*relative to that stream* — so input lands on the right monitor with no geometry
maths at all. Extraspace is a well-behaved GNOME app wrapped around those two APIs.

## Status

Everything below has been run end to end on real hardware — GNOME Shell 50.3
driving a Telekom T Tablet (Wingtech, Android 15) over USB.

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Virtual monitor creation, teardown | **Working** — appears alongside physical outputs |
| Capture → H.264 encode | **Working** — 55 fps at 1332×800 via `x264enc` |
| USB transport, handshake, APK auto-push | **Working** |
| Tablet-side decode and display | **Working** — MediaCodec, `low-latency=true` |
| Touch → cursor on the virtual monitor | **Working** — coordinates map exactly |
| Adaptive bitrate control | **Working** — queue 0, RTT ~1 ms, probes upward |
| Camera → `/dev/video10` | **Working** — 1920×1080 in any V4L2 app |
| Keyboard, stylus, audio, Wi-Fi | Not started — see [Roadmap](#roadmap) |

Measured on that setup: first frame **47 ms** after start, round trip **~1 ms**
over USB, decoder input queue steady at **0**.

This is a v0.1 that has been made to work on exactly one tablet and one GNOME
version. Reports from other hardware are the most useful thing you can send.

### Verifying it without a tablet

Everything above the tablet's decoder can be exercised on one machine, which is
also how you develop this if you do not have an Android device to hand.

**The whole host pipeline, against a simulated tablet:**

```console
$ cargo run -p xs-core --example fake_tablet
simulated tablet listening on 27183/27184/27185
  [tablet] sent Hello (2000x1200)
  [host] Creating the display…
  [host] streaming 1332x800 via OpenH264 (software, fallback)
  adapting bitrate new_kbps=7393
  adapting bitrate new_kbps=8393

--- simulated tablet results ---
  first video frame   152 ms after start
  video frames        57
  keyframes           3
  pings answered      20
  touch events sent   21

  PASS
```

That covers session orchestration, the handshake, virtual monitor creation,
capture, encoding, framing over real sockets, touch injection into the
compositor, and the adaptive controller probing upward on healthy samples. It
does not cover MediaCodec or anything USB-specific.

**Just the capture half, writing a file you can inspect:**

```console
$ cargo run -p xs-video --example capture_test
```

It writes `/tmp/extraspace-capture.h264` — `ffprobe` confirms Constrained
Baseline 1332×800, and `ffmpeg -i … -f null -` decodes every frame without error.

If you try it and something breaks, an issue with `RUST_LOG=debug` output is very
welcome.

## Requirements

- **GNOME 46 or newer on Wayland.** This is not portable to other compositors:
  it depends on mutter-specific D-Bus APIs that KDE, Sway and friends do not have.
  GNOME 50+ additionally lets the monitor be pinned to an exact mode.
- An **Android 11+** tablet (API 30, for `MediaCodec` low-latency decoding).
- A **USB cable** and USB debugging enabled on the tablet.
- Any GPU. Encoding is done on the CPU by default and needs roughly one core.

## Getting started

Four steps, once. After that it is plug in the cable and open the app.

### 1. Turn on USB debugging, on the tablet

This is the step everyone forgets, and it is why most first runs fail.

1. **Settings → About tablet** → tap **Build number** seven times.
2. **Settings → System → Developer options** → turn on **USB debugging**.
3. Plug in the USB cable. Accept the *Allow USB debugging?* prompt,
   ticking **Always allow from this computer**.

Skip step 3 and Extraspace will tell you exactly that, by name, rather than
failing with something cryptic.

> A surprising number of USB cables are charge-only and carry no data. If your
> tablet charges but never appears, try a different cable before anything else.

### 2. Set up the computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tymonoman/extraspace
cd extraspace
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This is the only step that needs `sudo`. It installs the GStreamer and GTK
packages, creates `/dev/video10` for the camera so it survives reboots, and
reports whether your tablet is visible. Run `./scripts/setup.sh --check` first if
you would rather see what it intends to do — that needs no privileges at all.

### 3. Get the companion app onto the tablet

Download `extraspace.apk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Tymonoman/extraspace/releases), then point
Extraspace at it once:

```bash
EXTRASPACE_APK=~/Downloads/extraspace.apk cargo run --release
```

It installs the app over USB for you — you never touch the tablet. From then on
the host checks the installed version on every connect and upgrades it silently,
so the two halves cannot drift apart, and you can drop the variable:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/extraspace
```

### 4. Add it to your applications

Optional, but you probably want it:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

Installs the binary, icon and desktop entry under `~/.local`, so Extraspace
appears in your app grid and runs from anywhere as `extraspace`. No root needed
— unlike `setup.sh`, this touches nothing system-wide. Undo it with
`./scripts/install.sh --uninstall`.

### 5. Use it

Open Extraspace and turn on **Extra Display**. The tablet switches to your
desktop within about a second, and a new monitor appears in
**Settings → Displays** that you can drag into position like any other.

## Usage

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Mode** | *Extend* adds a new monitor. *Mirror* copies an existing one. |
| **Scale** | How large the desktop is drawn on the tablet. See below. |
| **Tablet Camera** | Feeds the tablet camera into `/dev/video10`. |

The camera appears as **“Extraspace Tablet Camera”** in Firefox, Zoom, OBS,
Cheese and anything else that reads a webcam. It only shows up in those lists
while Extraspace is actually running, so it does not clutter your camera picker
the rest of the time.

### About scale

A 10.4" tablet at its native 2000×1200 renders GNOME at a size that is technically
correct and practically unreadable. Extraspace handles this by creating the
virtual monitor *smaller* than the panel and letting the tablet upscale:

| Scale | Monitor created | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1× | 2000 × 1200 | Pin-sharp, very small text |
| **1.5×** (default) | 1332 × 800 | Comfortable — the sweet spot |
| 2× | 1000 × 600 | Large text, noticeably soft |

Higher scale also costs less bandwidth, because there are fewer pixels to encode.

## How it works

The interesting part is the sequence, which is not obvious from mutter's interface
XML and took some experimentation to get right:

1. `RemoteDesktop.CreateSession()` → read its `SessionId`.
2. `ScreenCast.CreateSession({"remote-desktop-session-id": id})`. **Linking the two
   sessions is what makes injected input land on the virtual monitor.**
3. `ScreenCast.Session.RecordVirtual({ modes, is-platform, cursor-mode })`.
   - `is-platform: true` makes it a real monitor rather than a shared surface.
   - `modes` pins it to an exact resolution so PipeWire cannot renegotiate it.
4. Subscribe to `PipeWireStreamAdded` **before** starting, or the signal is missed.
5. `RemoteDesktop.Session.Start()` — *not* `ScreenCast.Session.Start()`, which
   mutter rejects for a linked session with *"Must be started from remote desktop
   session"*. Teardown is symmetric.

From there it is a normal GStreamer pipeline:

```
PipeWire capture + cursor overlay → appsrc → videorate (drop-only) → videoconvert → x264enc → h264parse → appsink → USB
```

and on the tablet, `MediaCodec` → `TextureView`. Touches travel back on a separate
socket and become `NotifyTouchDown/Motion/Up` calls, whose coordinates are already
in the virtual monitor's space.

### Notes from building it

Things that cost time, recorded so they cost you less:

- **`vulkanh264enc` silently ignores its bitrate setting.** It advertises CBR and
  accepts the property, but produces byte-identical output at 5, 15 and 40 Mbit/s.
  Unusable for adaptive streaming. Extraspace does not offer it.
- **Fedora strips NVENC out of GStreamer's `nvcodec` plugin.** Only the CUDA
  utility elements register; `nvh264enc` does not exist, and `plugins-freeworld`
  does not add it. `x264enc` at `veryfast` manages ~168 fps at 2000×1200 on a
  mid-range CPU, which is 2.8× more than needed, so this matters less than it sounds.
- **`x264enc` takes kbit/s but `openh264enc` takes bit/s.** A 1000× error waiting
  to happen; the conversion lives in exactly one function.
- **USB 2.0 is not the bottleneck.** Raw 2000×1200@60 would need ~550 MB/s, far
  beyond the ~30 MB/s a High Speed link gives you. Encoded H.264 at 15 Mbit/s is
  under 2 MB/s — roughly 15× headroom.
- **`adb forward` accepts connections to nothing.** adb accepts the *local* TCP
  connection whether or not anything is listening on the device, then closes it
  once the remote open fails. So `connect()` succeeds on the first attempt even
  when the companion app has not started, and the failure appears milliseconds
  later as an unexplained EOF mid-handshake. Retrying on connection-refused never
  helps, because connection-refused never happens. The only reliable readiness
  signal is bytes.
- **Half-closing one direction kills the whole channel.** Tokio's
  `OwnedWriteHalf` calls `shutdown(Write)` when dropped, and adb's forwarder tears
  down the entire unix socket to the device when either direction closes. Splitting
  a read-only stream and dropping the unused write half is therefore fatal — the
  peer's next write gets EPIPE. Streams used one way are not split at all here.
- **Mutter's embedded cursor only updates when the desktop is damaged.** Pointer
  motion is a hardware plane, not damage, so a still window freezes the cursor.
  Metadata mode plus a single PipeWire consumer that blits `SPA_META_Cursor` is
  the fix. A second consumer (`pipewiresrc` plus a listener) makes
  gst-plugin-pipewire abort on unfixed caps. A fullscreen GTK "damage pump"
  becomes an opaque black window on Meta-0.
- **Default `videorate` invents frames.** On a damage-driven capture (idle ~11
  fps) it duplicates the last buffer to fill 60 fps holes and builds seconds of
  fake catch-up latency. The pipeline is drop-only.
- **Draining MediaCodec only when input arrives loses the last frame.** Because
  mutter sends only on damage, an idle desktop delivers nothing for seconds at a
  time; if output is drained inside the input path, the final frame stays decoded
  but unrendered until something else changes. A dedicated drain thread fixed both
  that and the queue-depth telemetry, which had been reporting a stuck 6–8 and
  driving the bitrate to the floor for entire sessions.
- **"60 fps" is a ceiling, not a rate.** Mutter only emits a frame when something
  on the monitor actually changes, so a still desktop measures around **11 fps**
  and well under 1 Mbit/s. That is exactly what you want — an idle screen should
  be nearly free — but it quietly breaks anything that reasons in frame counts.
  Both encoders express their keyframe interval in frames, so the obvious
  `framerate × 2` puts keyframes *ten seconds* apart while idle, and a tablet
  that reconnects sits on a black screen until one arrives. The interval is sized
  against the idle rate instead, and a keyframe is requested explicitly whenever a
  tablet attaches.

## Troubleshooting

**"No tablet found"** — check `adb devices`. If it is empty, the cable may be
charge-only; many are. If it says `unauthorized`, accept the prompt on the tablet.

**"Something went wrong: no usable H.264 encoder"** — run
`./scripts/setup.sh`, or install `gstreamer1-plugins-ugly` (x264) or
`gstreamer1-plugin-openh264`.

**The virtual camera does not appear** — run `./scripts/setup.sh` to create
`/dev/video10`. Note that `exclusive_caps=1` deliberately hides it from
applications while nothing is feeding it, so it only shows up once streaming starts.

**The tablet shows a black screen** — check `adb logcat -s extraspace`. A protocol
mismatch is reported explicitly on both sides.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Keyboard passthrough (`NotifyKeyboardKeycode` — the plumbing is already there)
- [ ] Stylus with pressure, for tablets with an active pen
- [ ] Wi-Fi transport, reusing the same protocol
- [ ] Audio to the tablet speakers
- [ ] Tablet microphone as a PipeWire source
- [ ] Camera controls: tap-to-focus, torch, zoom
- [ ] Follow tablet rotation live

## Development

```bash
cargo test                                          # unit tests, no hardware needed
cargo run -p xs-mutter --example virtual_monitor    # create a monitor for 5 seconds
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run                            # verbose
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease             # build the companion app
```

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `xs-proto` | Wire protocol, shared with the Kotlin side |
| `xs-mutter` | Virtual monitor + input injection over D-Bus |
| `xs-video` | PipeWire capture → H.264 |
| `xs-transport` | adb orchestration, framed sockets |
| `xs-camera` | H.264 → `/dev/video10` |
| `xs-core` | Session orchestration, adaptive bitrate |
| `xs-ui` | GTK4 / libadwaita front end |

`xs-mutter` is the only crate that touches mutter's private D-Bus API, so if a
future GNOME release changes it, the damage is contained to one file.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome. The most useful thing right now is testing on
other tablets and other GNOME versions — please include your GNOME version,
distribution, and tablet model.

## License

[GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE).

Note that the default encoder, x264, is itself GPL-licensed, so a distributed
binary would carry GPL obligations regardless. Licensing the project this way
keeps the situation unambiguous.
